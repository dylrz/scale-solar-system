# [Scale Solar System](https://dylrz.github.io/scale-solar-system/): A Cosmic Canvas Simulation

Welcome to Scale Solar System, an interactive canvas-based simulation that brings the cosmos right to your browser! This project harnesses the power of HTML5 canvas and JavaScript to create a dynamic visualization of a solar system, complete with twinkling stars, wandering comets, and a detailed representation of our own solar system's planets.

## Features

**Dynamic Universe:** Experience an ever-changing universe with stars that twinkle, comets that streak across the sky, and planets that orbit in scaled real-time.

**Interactive Solar System:** Click on planets to learn fascinating facts about them. Discover details about their composition, orbits, and more.

**Responsive Design:** The canvas automatically adjusts to your screen size, ensuring a seamless experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

**Physics-Driven Motion:** Watch as the gravitational forces between celestial bodies influence their paths through space, all calculated in real-time.

**Zoom and Pan:** Explore the vastness of space with intuitive zoom and pan controls, allowing you to focus on the details or take in the grandeur of the entire solar system.

**Educational Insights:** Clicking on planets opens informative modals filled with interesting trivia and facts, making this simulation not just visually appealing but also educational.

## How It Works

**Canvas Setup:** At the heart of this simulation is the HTML5 canvas, where all the magic happens. The canvas is dynamically sized to fit the window, providing a vast stage for the simulation.

**Celestial Objects:** The script populates the universe with stars, comets, and a detailed solar system. Planets are rendered according to their real-world characteristics, such as size, color, and orbit, albeit scaled for visual clarity.

**Physics Simulation:** Utilizing simplified physics, each non-stationary object experiences gravitational forces from every other object, influencing its velocity and trajectory.

**User Interaction:** Through event listeners, the simulation responds to user actions. Resize events trigger a reconfiguration of the canvas dimensions and star generation, while mouse and touch events allow users to interact with the solar system, learning more about each planet.

**Animation Loop:** A continuous animation loop updates the positions of all objects, redraws their paths, and applies any user-induced transformations like zooming and panning.

## Explore and Learn

Scale Solar System is more than just a technical showcase; it's a gateway to the wonders of our universe. Whether you're a student, educator, or just a curious mind, this simulation offers a unique way to visualize the celestial mechanics that govern our solar system and beyond.
